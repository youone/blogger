The Swedish word "gl√§nta" is used for a small opening in a forest ("glade" in English), but it can also be used as a verb that means to slightly move an object - usually a door, curtain, or something of the like - in order to get a peek of what is on the other side of it.

The word is often used in metaphors for the act of entering and getting a glimpse of new and previously unknown territory of knowlege.
